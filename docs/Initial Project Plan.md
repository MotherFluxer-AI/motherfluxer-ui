# MotherFluxer Project Planning Document

## 1. System Overview
MotherFluxer is a model-agnostic, cloud-based platform that provides distributed access to AI models. While initially implemented with Phi-2, the system's architecture is deliberately model-agnostic to support future model updates and alternatives. The system has two key open source components: (1) a comprehensive UI and routing framework that provides full transparency into how requests are distributed, and (2) a flexible, deployable Docker container that can run various AI models. These open source components are supported by a secure private infrastructure that manages authentication and execution.

## 2. Key Components

### 2.1 Open Source Components

#### Public UI and Routing Framework (motherfluxer-ui)
- Purpose: Provide both the user interface and the complete routing methodology
- Key Features:
  - Chat interface
  - Response display
  - Complete routing algorithm implementation:
    - Load balancing logic
    - Health check methodology
    - Instance selection strategy
    - Failover handling
    - Request distribution algorithms
  - Detailed documentation of routing approach
  - Example implementations
  - Integration guides
- Technical Transparency:
  - Open source code showing exactly how requests are routed
  - Detailed explanation of load balancing decisions
  - Health check implementation details
  - Performance optimization strategies
- Security Considerations:
  - No sensitive data in codebase
  - HTTPS for all API calls
  - Standard input validation
  - Clear documentation

#### Model Container (motherfluxer-model)
- Purpose: Model-agnostic deployable AI container
- Currently using: Phi-2 model (easily swappable)
- Key Features:
  - Dockerized model environment
  - Health check endpoint
  - Basic monitoring
  - Auto-recovery
- Security Considerations:
  - Hardened container configuration
  - Requires valid credentials
  - Regular security updates
  - Health status reporting

### 2.2 Private Infrastructure

#### Authentication and Execution Gateway
- Purpose: Secure implementation of the open source routing methodology
- Key Features:
  - Executes the public routing algorithms
  - Maintains security of actual routing infrastructure
  - Controls access to model instances
  - Implements rate limiting

#### Central Router (superadmin.motherfluxer.ai)
- Purpose: Private implementation of the public routing methodology
- Key Features:
  - Executes the open source routing logic
  - Manages actual connections to instances
  - Maintains security and access control
  - Monitors system health

#### Database Layer
- Purpose: Store all sensitive data and system information
- Components:
  - PostgreSQL for primary data
  - Redis for caching
  - Secure backups

## 3. Core Workflows

### 3.1 Public User Workflow
1. User visits motherfluxer.ai
2. Tries demo version with limited requests
3. Can register for full access
4. All requests go through central routing

### 3.2 Registered User Workflow
1. User logs into user.motherfluxer.ai
2. Gets unlimited access to model
3. Requests are prioritized over public demo
4. Can save conversation history (future feature)

### 3.3 Admin User Workflow
1. Admin logs into admin.motherfluxer.ai
2. Downloads open source Docker package
3. Receives secure credentials
4. Deploys model instance with credentials
5. Instance automatically connects to central router

## 4. Security Model

### 4.1 Open Source Security
- UI Security:
  - No sensitive data in code
  - HTTPS for all API calls
  - Input validation
  - Clear documentation

- Container Security:
  - Hardened configuration
  - Credential-based access
  - Regular updates
  - Health monitoring

### 4.2 Private Infrastructure Security
- Authentication Gateway:
  - Controls all access
  - Validates all requests
  - Manages instance connections
  - Monitors for suspicious activity

- Data Protection:
  - Private database
  - Encrypted sensitive data
  - Secure backups
  - Access logging

## 5. AWS Infrastructure
- Route 53 for DNS management
- EC2 for application hosting
- RDS for PostgreSQL database
- ElastiCache for Redis
- S3 for static content
- CloudWatch for monitoring

## 6. Scalability Considerations
- Model-agnostic architecture allows easy updates
- Support for multiple model versions
- Flexible routing system
- Load balancing capabilities
- Future multi-region support

## 7. Risk Assessment
- Model instance reliability
- Network latency
- Resource constraints
- Security considerations
- Version compatibility
